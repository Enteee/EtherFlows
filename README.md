# EtherFlows
L2 powered flow processing.

## Idea
With a mapping of RSS-generated flow hashes into MAC address-space we can achive simple flow distribution with switching hardware. The [Flow Gen](/flogen/) program does the Flow -> MAC mapping, the [Flow worker](/flowworker) implements a sample flow processor.

## Requirments
### Flow Gen
* [dpdk >= 2.1.0][dpdk]
### Flow Woroker
* [python2][python2]
* [scapy][scapy]

[dpdk](http://dpdk.org/)
[python2](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/)
[scapy](http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/)
